# work&kite Website

The work&kite website is a landing page for a coworking space right at the kite spot.

On this website, users will find all the information they need about the equipment and service for both the coworking space and the Kiteboarding club. You can also send an inquiry if you have any questions or want to reserve a workspace.

## Design

![work&kite webpage Colour Scheme](assets/images/colour-scheme.png)

The website uses a palette of colors that is reflected in the photos on the website. The color palette was created using the [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) website.

### Typography

Google Fonts was used for the following fonts:

* Fira Sans was used for the entire website.
* Fira Sans was also used in italics, to create contrast.
* Fira Sans was used in the weights of 300-600.

### Images

The images on this webpage are all from Pexels. I've listed these in the Credits section.

### Wireframes

Wireframes were created for mobile, tablet, medium screen and big screen desktop.

### Accessibility

While coding, I made sure to make everything as accessible as possible by:

* using semantic HTML.
* using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
* ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
* ensuring menus are accessible by marking the current page as current for screen readers.

## Testing

I kept testing throughout the build process. For this I used Chrome Dev Tools. With this I was able to make the difficulties with the responsiveness and localize various style adjustments and adapt them accordingly.

Through my mentoring session, I was able to fix a display issue in my main section. Display: flex; brought the desired success.

### W3C Validator

The W3C validator was used to validate the HTML on all pages of the website. It was also used to validate CSS in the style.css file.

* Index Page HTML:
  ![work&kite webpage w3c Valiadtor](assets/images/W3C-index.png)
  
* Service Page HTML:
  ![work&kite webpage w3c Valiadtor](assets/images/W3C-service.png)
  
* Contact Us Page HTML:
  ![work&kite webpage w3c Valiadtor](assets/images/W3C-contact.png)

* CSS style Page:
  ![work&kite webpage w3c Valiadtor](assets/images/W3C-CSS.png)

### Known Bugs

1. In Codeanywhere there is always a problem message regarding the implementation of my Google font. This issue was discussed with my mentor. He assured me that it was not a problem and that no solution could be offered. An internet search did not bring the desired information either.

### Testing User Stories

* First Time Visitors:
  
  * I want to find out what work&kite is and what is offered. The main section of the home page explains what we are.
  * I want to be able to navigate the site easily to find information. The site navigation is in the top navigation bar, which consistently appears on all pages of the site.
  * I want to be able to find their social media accounts.

* Returning Visitors:

  * I want to know when which events are taking place.
  * I want to ask a question or make a reservation.

### Lighthouse

I used Lighthouse within the Chrome Developer Tools to allow me to test the performance and accessibility of the website.
